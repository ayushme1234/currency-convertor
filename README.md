Application of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

I developed a Currency Converter Web Application that converts amounts between different currencies using live exchange rates from an API.

HTML5 was used to create the structure of the app, including input fields for the amount, dropdown lists for selecting currencies, and a button to trigger conversion. Semantic elements such as <main> and <section> made the layout accessible and organized.

CSS3 styled the interface to be clean and responsive. I used flexbox for alignment, gradients for visual appeal, and hover effects for interactive feedback. Media queries ensured the design adapted to different screen sizes, making the app mobile-friendly.

JavaScript handled the appâ€™s logic and API integration. The fetch() method retrieved real-time exchange rates from the currency API. Event listeners captured user interactions, and the conversion result was displayed dynamically without reloading the page. I implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs or connectivity issues.

This project strengthened my skills in DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and responsive design. It demonstrated how HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript can work together to produce a functional and user-friendly application that addresses a practical need.
